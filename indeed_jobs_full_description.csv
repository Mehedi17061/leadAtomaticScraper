OwnHome’s mission is to turn renters into homeowners.
We believe all Australians deserve the opportunity to build a life and family in the security of their own home, especially the 4.5m young Australians who don't own the home they live in. For many renters, the biggest hurdle to homeownership isn’t the ongoing repayments of a mortgage — it’s saving hundreds of thousands of dollars for a 20% deposit, government taxes and legal fees.
The result of this structural inequality means that homeowners typically retire with 20x the wealth of renters, making declining homeownership rates one of the greatest social challenges of our generation. Meanwhile, two-thirds of First Home Buyers receive direct support from ‘The Bank of Mum & Dad’. For those without this help, the road to homeownership is almost $100,00 more expensive and takes almost twice as long. You may think this is unfair (and you’d be right).
About the role:
OwnHome is building Australia’s best home ownership experience. Our homeownership platform will support our customers through every aspect of purchasing and living in their home.
You will help us build a beautiful and elegant digital experience for our customers, as well as the powerhouse platform for your OwnHomies (colleagues) to support our customers along their journey.
As a Full Stack Software Engineer at OwnHome you will be:
An architectural voice in designing and building a scalable front and backend for our home buying and ownership platform.
Balancing rapid iteration speed with the overall stability, security, and modularity of our system.
Working closely with stakeholders in product, design, marketing, sales and operations to develop the best homebuying platform that is aligned with the wider OwnHome vision.
Collaborating and contributing to championing development processes, guidelines, and engineering practices for the team.
Fostering a culture of pragmatism in combination with best practices and your experience.
We’d be thrilled to have you join the OwnHome team because….
You have a couple of years in a similar role at other startups (ideally FinTech) or software companies under your belt and are eager to grow into a senior software engineer.
You love building creative and innovative solutions for customers.
Recent and knowledgeable experience building web products using technologies such as React, TypeScript, Node.js.
Working knowledge of any RDMS eg. SQL (PostgreSQL) or NoSQL database (eg. MongoDB)
Exposure to public cloud and managed cloud SaaS platforms.
Practical knowledge of designing and building reusable components, microservices and modules across multiple applications and code bases.
Experience working on customer-facing software projects with the ability to thoughtfully factor in requirements from stakeholders into a technical solution.
You’re able to elicit and understand user requirements to build an excellent digital customer experience.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
You are passionate about working in a fast-growing team and fast-moving environment.
What you’ll get from OwnHome
Freedom and trust that you will build incredible products, solving huge real-world problems.
A generous salary and equity package - you are a business builder and owner of one of Australia’s fastest growing startups.
Mentorship and support from our amazing leaders.
Flexible working from our casual office in Potts Point.
Health / fitness / phone allowance.
Office goodies. Just tell us what you need to thrive.
